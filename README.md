    ```

2.  **Set up the backend (Node.js/Express):**
    ```bash
    cd backend_api
    npm install
    # Configure your MongoDB connection URI
    npm start
    # Or use a development server like:
    # npm run dev
    ```

3.  **Set up the frontend (Flutter):**
    ```bash
    cd multi_store_app
    flutter pub get
    flutter run
